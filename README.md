# CallCenter

Example of using OOP and TPL.

The Task: one base clas and three child classes making hierarchy of "call-center". Every class in hierarchy has method that can "take a call" from spawning clients. Higher the class in hierarchy - faster client's problem can be solved, but employees in lower ranks should be busy so higher rank employee can answer the incoming call. In the end there is total statistics.
